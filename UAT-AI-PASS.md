## What is an AI Pass?

An AI Pass is when artificial intelligence editors review your manuscript and suggest improvements. Think of it like having professional Copy Editors and Line Editors review your work, but powered by AI. The system will analyze your text and suggest corrections for spelling, grammar, style, and clarity.
