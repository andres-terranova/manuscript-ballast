# Large Document AI Processing: Research & Implementation Plan

## ⚠️ DEPRECATED IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

**This document previously described complex custom chunking approaches that have been superseded by TipTap's native features.**

## ✅ Updated Implementation: TipTap Native System

### Executive Summary

After extensive research and multiple implementation attempts, we determined that **TipTap's built-in chunking and caching system** is the optimal solution for large document processing. Custom resolver implementations were causing more problems than they solved.

### Key Discovery

**The root cause of issues was fighting against TipTap's architecture instead of leveraging it.**

- **Previous approach**: Custom resolver with manual chunking and rate limiting
- **Current approach**: Native TipTap features (`enableCache`, `chunkSize`)
- **Result**: Simplified, more reliable implementation

### Research Findings

#### What We Learned the Hard Way

1. **TipTap's API is designed for their chunking system** - Custom chunking interferes with their internal rate limiting
2. **HTML structure matters** - Converting to plain text loses important context
3. **Native caching is crucial** - TipTap's caching reduces redundant API calls
4. **Custom resolvers are for different LLMs** - Not for chunking the same API

#### Failed Approaches

1. **❌ Custom Resolver with Text Chunking**
   - Converted HTML to plain text
   - Lost document structure
   - Caused 429 rate limit errors
   - Complex position adjustment logic

2. **❌ Dynamic Resolver Override**
   - Attempted runtime override of `editor.storage.aiSuggestion.resolver`
   - This property doesn't exist/isn't writable
   - Configuration must happen at extension initialization

3. **❌ Content Replacement Strategy**
   - Temporarily replaced editor content with chunks
   - Destroyed document formatting and paragraph breaks
   - Caused infinite loading loops

### ✅ Final Implementation

**Simple, native TipTap configuration:**

```typescript
// File: src/hooks/useTiptapEditor.ts
AiSuggestion.configure({
  enableCache: true,    // Use TipTap's built-in caching
  chunkSize: 10,       // 10 HTML nodes per chunk
  // No custom resolver needed!
})
```

**User experience logic:**

```typescript
// File: src/components/workspace/ExperimentalEditor.tsx
// Detect large documents for user feedback only
const isLargeDocument = documentLength > 100000;

if (isLargeDocument) {
  toast({
    title: "Processing large document",
    description: "TipTap will process in chunks with native caching.",
  });
}

// Standard TipTap AI loading
editor.chain().loadAiSuggestions().run();
```

### Implementation Phases

#### Phase 1: Completed ✅
- Removed all custom resolver logic
- Configured native TipTap chunking
- Fixed TypeScript errors
- Updated documentation

#### Phase 2: Future Consideration
Only if native chunking proves insufficient:
- Tune `chunkSize` parameter (5-20 HTML nodes)
- Adjust `enableCache` settings
- Monitor performance and adjust

#### Phase 3: Only if Required
Custom solutions only for:
- Different LLM integration (non-TipTap APIs)
- Business-specific suggestion logic
- Specialized document types

### Performance Expectations

**With Native Chunking:**
- TipTap handles rate limiting internally
- Caching reduces redundant processing
- HTML structure preserved throughout
- Simplified error handling

### Key Learnings

1. **Trust the vendor's expertise** - TipTap knows their API best
2. **Native features first** - Always try built-in options before custom solutions
3. **Simplicity wins** - Complex custom logic often creates more problems
4. **Read the docs thoroughly** - TipTap has extensive chunking documentation we initially missed

### Documentation to Ignore

The following approaches in this codebase are **deprecated**:
- Custom resolver implementations
- Manual chunking algorithms
- Runtime resolver overrides
- Queue-based backend processing for TipTap AI
- Complex position adjustment logic

### Future Research Priorities

1. **Monitor TipTap's roadmap** for new native features
2. **Test different `chunkSize` values** for optimization
3. **Evaluate caching effectiveness** in production
4. **Consider TipTap's upcoming features** before building custom solutions

## Conclusion

The most important lesson: **Use TipTap's native features first.** The complex implementation plans in this document were solved by a simple configuration change.

**Current status: IMPLEMENTED AND WORKING**

This serves as a reminder that sometimes the best solution is the simplest one that leverages existing, well-tested vendor capabilities.
