## What are AI Editor Roles?

AI Editor Roles are the different types of professional editors that can review your manuscript. Each role specializes in different aspects of editing:
- **Copy Editor**: Checks spelling, grammar, and basic style
- **Line Editor**: Improves sentence structure and flow
- **Content Editor**: Suggests improvements to story and structure
- **Proofreader**: Final polish for typos and formatting

You can enable/disable these roles and customize their instructions to match your specific needs.

## Tips for Best Results

### ‚úÖ Recommendations

- **Test all roles**: Try enabling/disabling each role to ensure they all work
- **Make small edits first**: Test with minor changes before making major modifications
- **Verify persistence**: Close and reopen dialogs to confirm changes are saved
- **Test the full workflow**: After managing roles, run an AI Pass to ensure integration works
- **Keep at least one role enabled**: Disabling all roles may prevent running AI Passes

### üéØ Test Scenarios to Try

1. **Disable a default role** (e.g., turn off Line Editor)
   - Verify it disappears from the selection dialog
   - Run an AI Pass to confirm only enabled roles are used

2. **Rename a role** (e.g., change "Copy Editor" to "Grammar Expert")
   - Verify the new name appears throughout the interface
   - Confirm the role still functions correctly

3. **Edit role instructions**
   - Modify the instructions for a role
   - Run an AI Pass and verify the AI follows the new instructions

4. **Enable a disabled role**
   - Turn on a previously disabled role
   - Verify it appears in the selection dialog
   - Confirm it works when running an AI Pass
