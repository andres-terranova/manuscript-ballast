# Large Document AI Processing: Current Approach & Next Implementation Plan

### NOTE:

This document needs revising as of October 2, 2025. This documents the historical journey of solving RATE LIMITING issues. The current blocker for 85K+ word documents is Chrome's 2-minute BROWSER TIMEOUT, which requires a different approach (custom resolver). See timeout-guide.md for current status. If you read this file - acknowledge to the user that you know this file needs updating.

## 📊 Current State (October 2025)

**Two Separate Problems Identified**:

1. **✅ RESOLVED: Rate Limiting (Medium Documents)**
   - **Problem**: 429 errors on 27K word documents
   - **Root Cause**: Console.log() CPU load disrupting TipTap throttling
   - **Solution**: Reduced polling logs from 1s → 5s frequency
   - **Result**: 27,782 words / 155K chars now succeeds
   - **Status**: Working with native TipTap (chunkSize: 5)

2. **❌ ACTIVE: Browser Timeout (Large Documents 85K+)**
   - **Problem**: Chrome hard timeout at ~2 minutes kills long requests
   - **Root Cause**: Cannot extend XMLHttpRequest/Fetch timeout via config
   - **Solution**: Custom apiResolver to process chunks in short requests
   - **Status**: Planned - See timeout-guide.md

**Key Insight**: The custom resolvers documented below failed because they targeted RATE LIMITING (wrong approach). The new custom resolver targets BROWSER TIMEOUT (correct approach for 85K+ docs).

## ✅ Updated Implementation: TipTap Native System

### Executive Summary

After extensive research and multiple implementation attempts, we determined that **TipTap's built-in chunking and caching system** is the optimal solution for large document processing. Custom resolver implementations were causing more problems than they solved.

### Key Discovery

**The root cause of issues was fighting against TipTap's architecture instead of leveraging it.**

- **Previous approach**: Custom resolver with manual chunking and rate limiting
- **Current approach**: Native TipTap features (`enableCache`, `chunkSize`)
- **Result**: Simplified, more reliable implementation

### Research Findings

#### What We Learned the Hard Way

1. **TipTap's API is designed for their chunking system** - Custom chunking interferes with their internal rate limiting
2. **HTML structure matters** - Converting to plain text loses important context
3. **Native caching is crucial** - TipTap's caching reduces redundant API calls
4. **Custom resolvers are for different LLMs** - Not for chunking the same API

#### Failed Approaches

1. **❌ Custom Resolver with Text Chunking**
   - Converted HTML to plain text
   - Lost document structure
   - Caused 429 rate limit errors
   - Complex position adjustment logic

2. **❌ Dynamic Resolver Override**
   - Attempted runtime override of `editor.storage.aiSuggestion.resolver`
   - This property doesn't exist/isn't writable
   - Configuration must happen at extension initialization

3. **❌ Content Replacement Strategy**
   - Temporarily replaced editor content with chunks
   - Destroyed document formatting and paragraph breaks
   - Caused infinite loading loops

### ✅ Current Implementation

**Simple, native TipTap configuration:**

```typescript
// File: src/hooks/useTiptapEditor.ts
AiSuggestion.configure({
  enableCache: true,    // Use TipTap's built-in caching
  chunkSize: 5,         // Works for 27K words (post console.log fix)
  // No custom resolver needed!
})
```

**User experience logic:**

```typescript
// File: src/components/workspace/ExperimentalEditor.tsx
// Detect large documents for user feedback only
const isLargeDocument = documentLength > 100000;

if (isLargeDocument) {
  toast({
    title: "Processing large document",
    description: "TipTap will process in chunks with native caching.",
  });
}

// Standard TipTap AI loading
editor.chain().loadAiSuggestions().run();
```

### Implementation Phases

#### Phase 1: Completed ✅
- Removed all custom resolver logic
- Configured native TipTap chunking
- Fixed TypeScript errors
- Updated documentation

#### Phase 2: Current Optimization Options
- ✅ Console.log fix applied (Oct 1, 2025) - Enabled 27K word processing
- 🔄 Possible: Dynamic chunkSize based on document size
  - Small docs (<10K words): chunkSize: 3-5
  - Medium docs (10K-27K): chunkSize: 5-10
  - Large docs (27K+): Needs custom resolver for browser timeout
- Monitor performance with current chunkSize: 5

#### Phase 3: Custom Resolver (IN PROGRESS for 85K+ docs)
Custom apiResolver required for:
- ✅ **85K+ word documents** - Browser timeout bypass (PRIMARY USE CASE)
- Different LLM integration (non-TipTap APIs)
- Business-specific suggestion logic
- Specialized document types

See timeout-guide.md for implementation details.

### Performance Expectations

**With Native Chunking:**
- TipTap handles rate limiting internally
- Caching reduces redundant processing
- HTML structure preserved throughout
- Simplified error handling

### Key Learnings

1. **Trust the vendor's expertise** - TipTap knows their API best
2. **Native features first** - Always try built-in options before custom solutions
3. **Simplicity wins** - Complex custom logic often creates more problems
4. **Read the docs thoroughly** - TipTap has extensive chunking documentation we initially missed

### Future Research Priorities

1. ✅ **COMPLETED**: Console.log CPU load fix enabled 27K word processing
2. **IN PROGRESS**: Custom resolver for 85K+ word browser timeout bypass
3. **POTENTIAL**: Dynamic chunkSize adjustment based on document size
4. **Evaluate caching effectiveness** in production with various document sizes

## Conclusion

The journey documented in this file solved the **rate limiting problem** by returning to native TipTap features and fixing console.log CPU contention. Key lessons:

1. **Native features first** - For medium documents (27K words), native TipTap with console.log fix works perfectly
2. **Don't fight the framework** - Failed custom resolvers for rate limiting proved this
3. **Custom resolver has its place** - Now needed for 85K+ documents to bypass browser timeout (different problem, different solution)

**Current Recommendation**:
- Medium docs (< 27K words): ✅ Use native TipTap (chunkSize: 5, console.log fix applied)
- Large docs (85K+ words): 🔄 Implement custom apiResolver (see timeout-guide.md)

This isn't contradictory - the failed custom resolvers targeted the wrong problem (rate limiting). The new custom resolver targets the right problem (browser timeout).
