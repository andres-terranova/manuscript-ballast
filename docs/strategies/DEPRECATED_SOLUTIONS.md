# Deprecated Large Document Solutions

## Overview

This document lists files created during investigation of the large document rate limiting issue. These solutions are **no longer needed** as the root cause was identified and fixed simply.

**The Fix**: Changed `chunkSize: 10` to `chunkSize: 2` in `src/hooks/useTiptapEditor.ts:116`

---

## Deprecated Code Files

### Rate Limiting & Queue Management (NOT NEEDED)
These files implemented complex retry logic and request queuing that are unnecessary with the correct chunk size:

- **`src/lib/tiptapRateLimitHandler.ts`** - Exponential backoff retry logic
- **`src/lib/tiptapApiQueue.ts`** - Request queue with token bucket algorithm
- **`src/lib/documentChunkingStrategy.ts`** - Manual document chunking
- **`src/lib/optimizedAiPassHandler.ts`** - Combined optimization handler

**Status**: Keep but don't use. TipTap's built-in chunking with `chunkSize: 2` handles everything.

---

### React Performance Optimization (OPTIONAL - MAY BE USEFUL LATER)
These files optimize React rendering for 1000+ suggestions. Not needed for the rate limit fix, but could be useful for UI performance:

- **`src/components/workspace/VirtualSuggestionList.tsx`** - Virtual scrolling component
- **`src/hooks/useConcurrentSuggestions.ts`** - React 18 concurrent rendering

**Status**: Keep for future if rendering performance becomes an issue with large suggestion counts.

## Deprecated Documentation

### Strategy Documents (ARCHIVED)
- **`docs/strategies/LARGE_DOCUMENT_PLAYBOOK.md`** - 10 complex strategies (marked deprecated)
- **`docs/architecture/REACT_SUGGESTION_RENDERING_STRATEGY.md`** - React rendering architecture
- **`docs/guides/REACT_SUGGESTION_INTEGRATION.md`** - React integration guide
- **`docs/guides/TIPTAP_API_OPTIMIZATION_GUIDE.md`** - API optimization strategies

**Status**: Archived for reference. The simple solution (chunkSize: 2) solves the problem.

---

## What Should You Use Instead?

### For Large Document Processing
- **Use**: TipTap's default `chunkSize: 2`
- **See**: `docs/guides/LARGE_DOCUMENT_TIMEOUT_GUIDE.md` (updated with correct solution)
- **File**: `src/hooks/useTiptapEditor.ts:116`

### Current Configuration (Optimal)
```typescript
AiSuggestion.configure({
  chunkSize: 2,           // TipTap's default - no custom logic needed!
  enableCache: true,      // Already on by default
  loadOnStart: false,
  reloadOnUpdate: false,
  debounceTimeout: 800,
})
```

## Why Were These Created?

During investigation, we initially thought the problem was complex and required:
- Custom retry logic
- Request queuing
- Manual chunking
- Virtual scrolling
- Server-side processing
- Differential updates

**Reality**: We just needed to use TipTap's recommended default settings.

---

## Should These Files Be Deleted?

**Recommendation**: Keep them but mark as deprecated

**Reasons**:
1. **Learning**: Show evolution of understanding the problem
2. **Future Reference**: May be useful if we encounter actual timeout issues (not just rate limiting)
3. **React Optimization**: Virtual scrolling might be useful if we have UI performance issues

**Important**: Don't implement these solutions unless you have a specific problem that requires them.

## Testing Checklist

Before considering any of these deprecated solutions:

- [ ] Have you tried `chunkSize: 2`?
- [ ] Have you tested with documents >100K words?
- [ ] Are you still seeing 429 errors with chunkSize: 2?
- [ ] Have you verified your TipTap API tier/limits?
- [ ] Is the issue actually rendering performance (not API rate limits)?

If you answered "yes" to all above, only then consider the React optimization files.
