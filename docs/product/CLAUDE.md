# v1.0 Feature Specifications

## Overview

This document details the simplified v1.0 feature set focused on the Editor ‚Üî Author workflow. Features are organized by implementation phase.

**v1.0 Timeline**: ~10 weeks to functional release
**Core Focus**: Enable editors to send manuscripts to authors and receive them back with tracked changes

## Phase 1: Foundation ‚úÖ (Complete - October 2025)

### 1.1 Large Document Processing ‚≠ê
**Status**: ‚úÖ Production Ready

**What it does**: Processes manuscripts up to 85K words with parallel batch AI suggestions

**Key Components**:
- Custom apiResolver in `src/hooks/useTiptapEditor.ts`
- Edge function: `supabase/functions/ai-suggestions-html/`
- Parallel batch processing (5 chunks concurrent)

**Performance**:
- Up to 85K words supported
- 5,005 suggestions in ~15-20 minutes
- 99.9%+ position accuracy
- Zero rate limiting (313 requests, 0 √ó 429 errors)

**Known Limitations**:
- Browser freeze on 5,000+ suggestions (functional but poor UX)
- High memory usage (1.5 GB) on large docs
- Background queue recommended for future optimization

**Documentation**: [Phase 1 UAT Findings](../02-technical/large-documents/UAT-PHASE1-FINDINGS.md)

---

### 1.2 DOCX Import via Queue
**Status**: ‚úÖ Production Ready

**What it does**: Background processing of DOCX uploads without timeout errors

**Key Components**:
- `supabase/functions/queue-processor/`
- `processing_queue` table
- `useQueueProcessor.ts` hook

**Performance**:
- Small docs (189KB): ~1.5s
- Large docs (437KB): ~3s
- Auto-processing delay: Max 10s

---

### 1.3 AI-Powered Suggestions (TipTap Pro Extension) ‚≠ê
**Status**: ‚úÖ Production Ready

**What it does**: TipTap Pro AI Suggestion extension generates comprehensive inline suggestions using OpenAI GPT-4

**üö® Implementation Details** (Critical for Developers):
- **Extension**: TipTap Pro AI Suggestion (commercial license, JWT auth required)
- **Main File**: `src/components/workspace/Editor.tsx` (NOT ManuscriptWorkspace.tsx)
- **Configuration**: `src/hooks/useTiptapEditor.ts:85-236`
- **Documentation**:
  - [TipTap AI Overview](https://tiptap.dev/docs/content-ai/capabilities/suggestion)
  - [Custom LLMs Guide](https://tiptap.dev/docs/content-ai/capabilities/suggestion/custom-llms)
  - [API Reference](https://tiptap.dev/docs/content-ai/capabilities/suggestion/api-reference)

**How It Works**:
1. User clicks "Run AI Pass" in toolbar
2. `editor.chain().loadAiSuggestions().run()` triggers processing
3. TipTap chunks document into ~10 nodes per chunk
4. Custom apiResolver sends chunks to edge function in parallel batches of 5
5. Edge function (`ai-suggestions-html`) processes each chunk with selected AI rules
6. ALL suggestions loaded at once when complete (NOT progressive)
7. `convertAiSuggestionsToUI()` transforms and sorts by document position
8. Suggestions display in editor with popovers and in ChangeList sidebar

**Key Functions**:
- `waitForAiSuggestions()` - Monitors completion via `editor.extensionStorage.aiSuggestion`
- `convertAiSuggestionsToUI()` - Transforms TipTap format to our UISuggestion type
- `editor.storage.aiSuggestion.getSuggestions()` - Retrieves all loaded suggestions
- `editor.commands.applyAiSuggestion()` - Accepts a suggestion
- `editor.commands.rejectAiSuggestion()` - Rejects a suggestion

**Available Roles** (v1.0):
- **Copy Editor** - Grammar, spelling, punctuation (Crimson)
- **Line Editor** - Sentence structure, clarity, flow (Orange)
- **Proofreader** - Final polish, consistency (Purple)
- **CMOS Formatter** - Chicago Manual of Style rules (Blue)

**Configuration**:
- `AIEditorRules.tsx` - Rule definitions with prompts
- `AIEditorRuleSelector.tsx` - UI for selecting active rules
- `ChangeList.tsx` - Suggestion review panel (sorted by position)

**Performance**:
- Small docs (<10K words): ~2 min, 200-500 suggestions
- Medium docs (10-30K words): ~5-10 min, 1,000-2,000 suggestions
- Large docs (30-85K words): ~15-20 min, 3,000-5,000 suggestions
- Note: 5K+ suggestions cause browser freeze during rendering (not loading)

**Deferred to v1.1+**:
- Fact Checker role
- Manuscript Evaluator role
- Developmental Editor role
- Progressive rendering for 5K+ suggestions
