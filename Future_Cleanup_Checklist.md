## üìã **Future Cleanup Checklist (Updated)**

### **üöÄ Production Ready Items:**

- [ ]  Replace hardcoded JWT tokens with environment variables
- [ ]  Create proper `.env` file configuration
- [ ]  Set up JWT token renewal (24-hour expiration)
- [ ]  Configure production Allowed Origins

### **üìö Large Document Support: ‚úÖ COMPLETED**

**Core Infrastructure (‚úÖ Complete):**
- [x]  **Queue-based processing system** - Eliminates WORKER_LIMIT errors completely
- [x]  **CPU timeout protection** - 1.8s processing limit with graceful fallbacks  
- [x]  **Real-time progress indicators** - Step-by-step status updates (extracting_text 50%, etc.)
- [x]  **Auto-processing system** - 10-second polling with automatic job execution
- [x]  **Error recovery & retry** - Handles stuck jobs, timeouts, and processing failures
- [x]  **Memory optimization** - CPU-aware processing with fast HTML fallbacks
- [x]  **Tested capacity** - Successfully processes 60K+ word documents (437KB files)
- [x]  **Adaptive timeouts** - Dynamic timeout calculation based on available CPU time

**Optional UX Enhancements (Future):**
- [ ]  **Processing scope selector**: "Current Chapter", "Selected Text", "Full Document"
- [ ]  **Suggestion pagination**: Display 50-100 suggestions at a time for better UX
- [ ]  **Multi-document batch processing**: Process multiple manuscripts simultaneously
- [ ]  **Smart content selection**: Process current chapter/section instead of full document

> **üìù Note:** The queue system architecture completely solves the original WORKER_LIMIT problem and can handle documents of any reasonable size. See `QUEUE_SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md` for technical details.

### **üîß Code Quality:**

- [ ]  Update `EXPERIMENTAL_AI_SETUP.md` with final working configuration
- [ ]  Add JSDoc comments to AI suggestion functions
- [ ]  Consider extracting AI utilities to separate module

### **üìã AI Editor Roles Implementation Roadmap:**

#### **Phase 2: Add Holistic Analysis**
- [ ]  Create separate "Document Analysis" system for Manuscript Evaluation Agent
- [ ]  Create separate "Document Analysis" system for Developmental Editor Agent
- [ ]  Design structured report modal/panel that shows feedback instead of inline suggestions
- [ ]  Implement document-wide analysis that generates structured reports with:
  - [ ]  Plot/pacing analysis (fiction) or argument/logic flow (nonfiction)
  - [ ]  Character development assessment
  - [ ]  Structural gap identification
  - [ ]  Actionable recommendations summary
- [ ]  Enable the "Manuscript Evaluation Agent" and "Developmental Editor Agent" rules

#### **Phase 3: Integration & Advanced Features**
- [ ]  Create preset "workflows" that run multiple passes:
  - [ ]  "Quick Polish" (Copy Editor + Line Editor)
  - [ ]  "Full Editorial Pass" (all 6 roles)
  - [ ]  "Structure Review" (Manuscript Evaluator + Developmental Editor)
  - [ ]  "Publication Ready" (all roles in sequence)
- [ ]  Add progress tracking for multi-stage analysis
- [ ]  Implement workflow templates with customizable rule combinations
- [ ]  Add "AI Editor Workflow" builder for custom editing sequences
- [ ]  Create analytics/reporting on suggestion acceptance rates by role
