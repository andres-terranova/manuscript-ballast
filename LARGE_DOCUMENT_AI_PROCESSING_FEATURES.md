# Large Document AI Processing Features

## ⚠️ DEPRECATED IMPLEMENTATION - UPDATED APPROACH BELOW

**Previous versions of this document described a custom resolver approach that has been replaced with TipTap's native chunking system.**

## ✅ Current Implementation: TipTap Native Chunking

### Overview

The AI Suggestions system now uses TipTap's built-in chunking and caching features to handle large documents. This approach is simpler, more reliable, and works with TipTap's internal rate limiting.

### Native Features Used

**TipTap Configuration**:
```typescript
// File: src/hooks/useTiptapEditor.ts
AiSuggestion.configure({
  enableCache: true,      // Use TipTap's built-in caching
  chunkSize: 10,         // 10 HTML nodes per chunk
  // No custom resolver needed for chunking!
})
```

### Key Benefits

1. **Built-in Rate Limiting**: TipTap handles API rate limits internally
2. **HTML Structure Preservation**: Chunks maintain document structure (no plain text conversion)
3. **Automatic Caching**: Reduces redundant API calls for processed chunks
4. **Simpler Implementation**: No custom chunking logic required

### Automatic Operation

- **Size Detection**: System still detects large documents (100K+ characters)
- **User Feedback**: Displays appropriate messages for large document processing
- **Seamless Processing**: TipTap handles all chunking and API management internally

### Configuration

**Current Settings**:
- `enableCache: true` - Enables automatic caching per chunk
- `chunkSize: 10` - Number of HTML nodes per chunk (adjustable)
- No custom delays or rate limiting code needed

### User Experience

**Toast Notifications**:
```typescript
toast({
  title: "Processing large document",
  description: `Document is ${Math.round(documentLength/1000)}K characters. TipTap will process in chunks with native caching.`,
  duration: 5000
});
```

### Files Modified

**Current Implementation**:
- `src/hooks/useTiptapEditor.ts` - TipTap configuration with native chunking
- `src/components/workspace/ExperimentalEditor.tsx` - Size detection and user feedback

**Removed/Deprecated**:
- ❌ Custom resolver logic
- ❌ `setupLargeDocumentResolver` function
- ❌ `smartChunkText` utility function
- ❌ Manual rate limiting delays

## What Changed

### Before (Custom Resolver - DEPRECATED)
```typescript
// ❌ WRONG - Don't do this
resolver: async ({ defaultResolver, html, rules, ...options }) => {
  // Custom chunking logic
  // Manual rate limiting
  // Position adjustment
}
```

### After (Native System - CURRENT)
```typescript
// ✅ CORRECT - Use TipTap's native features
AiSuggestion.configure({
  enableCache: true,    // Let TipTap handle caching
  chunkSize: 10,       // Let TipTap handle chunking
  // API rate limiting handled internally
})
```

## Important Notes

1. **Trust TipTap's System**: Their native chunking is designed for their API
2. **No Custom Resolvers for Chunking**: Only use custom resolvers for different LLMs
3. **HTML Node Chunking**: TipTap chunks by HTML structure, not character count
4. **Internal Rate Limiting**: TipTap manages their own API rate limits

## Performance Expectations

- **Automatic Processing**: TipTap handles chunking transparently
- **Built-in Caching**: Reduces processing time for repeated operations
- **API Compliance**: Internal rate limiting prevents 429 errors
- **Maintained Quality**: Suggestions quality preserved across chunks

## Future Considerations

The native system should handle most use cases. Only consider custom solutions if:
- Integrating non-TipTap LLMs
- Adding business-specific logic to suggestions
- TipTap's chunking proves insufficient for specific edge cases

**Always try the native approach first before implementing custom solutions.**

## Conclusion

By switching to TipTap's native chunking system, we've achieved:
- ✅ Simplified implementation
- ✅ Better API compliance
- ✅ Reduced maintenance overhead
- ✅ More reliable processing
- ✅ Alignment with TipTap's design patterns

The native approach leverages the vendor's expertise in handling their own API, resulting in a more robust solution.
